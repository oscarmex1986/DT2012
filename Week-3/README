Possible trouble you might find.

Since we are working in a multilingual environment, it is possible that your computer settings are configured to represent and interpret data differently.

For example:

If I say I arrived in Sweden in 09/06/2021, did I arrive in September or in June?
If I say my luggage weights 23,300 kilos, did I come by plane or by freight ship?
If I say the temperature back home was 5.600 degrees, was I burning or freezing?

Java normally uses en_US (American English) as its Locale, and expects data to be in that format.

Commas separate thousands, dots indicate the beginning of the decimal part.

If you have trouble with the scanner, set the locale with the following command:
new Scanner(System.in).useLocale(Locale.US);

It requires importing Locale:
import java.util.Locale;
